Your challenge is write a program to ask the user to enter their school username in the following format:
Year Group Using two digits (e.g. “07” for year 7, “11” for year 11, “00” for staff members)
1 character for their initial (first letter of their firstname)
The user’s lastname
A 2-digit code: “\_S” for students, “\_T” for teachers, “\_A” for admin staff.
For instance the following usernames are valid usernames:

07jFox_S
09kJohnson_S
11rTaylor_S
00pJones_T
00jOliver_A

Your program should read the username and decide:

- If the username is less than 6 characters long the program should ask the user to enter a valid username.
- If the username does not contain the character “\_” it should also ask the user to enter a valid username.
- If the username is valid, the program should decide if the user is a member of staff or a student.
- If they are a student the programme should find out their year group.
- The program should also display the initial of the student as well as their lastname.
- Finally the program should display whether the user is a Student, a Teacher or an Admin member of staff.
