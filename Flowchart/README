### Poker Dice Game

- The aim of this challenge is to create a simplified game of Poker Dice using only three dice.
  The computer will generate three random numbers between 1 and 6.

The program will then check to see if the three dice have the same value (“Three of a kind!”) or if any two of the three dice have the same value (“Pair”).

#### Extra

- improve your code further to find out if:
- The 3 dice are all even numbers.
- The 3 dice are all odd numbers.
